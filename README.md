# E-Commerce-Project
This project is an end-to-end E-Commerce Data Analysis system developed using Python and MySQL. The primary goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce transactional data and extract meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and business growth trends. The project simulates a real-world business scenario where raw data stored in a relational database is transformed into actionable insights through structured queries and data visualization. The project focuses on applying SQL analytics concepts and integrating them with Python-based data analysis, making it suitable for roles such as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and SQL Developer.
